      <span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;">So after googling, I figure out a list of
      the top 10 most innovative universities in the world so here is the
      list.</span></div>

      University</b>:- Stanford University takes first place as World's Most Innovative
      Universities. The university has locked down the top spot by consistently producing new
      patents and papers that influence researchers around the globe.</span></li>

      of Technology</b>:- Another my favorite university is MIT which is also in the USA and
      the second most innovative university in the world for the fourth year running, in part
      because its research is cited more than any other university in independent patent
      applications and journal articles. Founded in 1861 with the goal of "aiding the advancement,
      development and practical application of science," MIT research has fueled some of the most
      important innovations of the past century, including the development of digital computers and
      the completion of the Human Genome Project. In its 158-year history, the university's student
      and staff alumni have included 90 Nobel laureates, 59 National Medal of Science winners, 75
      MacArthur Fellows, and 29 National Medal of Technology and Innovation
      winners.</span></li>

      undergrad program only accepts about 6,700 students each year, more than 1.6 million students
      from 195 countries have enrolled in classes via HarvardX, the university's free online
      learning program.<span
