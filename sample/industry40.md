      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: large;">Is India ready
      for Industry 4.0?</span></span></h2>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size:
      medium;">Industrialization started with steam and the first machines that mechanized some
      of the work that our people did. Subsequently, we had electricity, assembly lines and the
      birth of mass production and then the third era of industry came in with the advent of
      computers and the beginning of automation when robots and machines began replacing the
      workforce on those assembly lines. &nbsp;</span></span></div>
      </div>
      <div style="font-family: Baskerville; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;
      text-indent: 27px;">
      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now we are
      expected to enter a new world of Industry 4.0, in which computers and automation will come
      together in an altogether new way, with robotics connected remotely to computer systems
      equipped with machine learning algorithms that can control the robotics with minimum human
      support. During the past decade's industry 3.0 make a huge leap forward. During this period
      the civilization changes and revolution come in computerization and automation but now we talk
      about industry 4.0 where people considering it as a combination of artificial intelligence,
      machine learning, and IoT and put together to ultimately make machines capable of making
      decisions with minimal human intervention.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size:
      medium;"><b>Industry 4.0</b> is the subset of the fourth industrial revolution.
      Although the terms "industry 4.0" and "fourth industrial revolution" are often used
      interchangeably, "<b>industry 4.0</b>" refers to the concept of factories in which
      machines are augmented with wireless connectivity and sensors, connected to a system that can
      visualize the entire production line and make decisions on its own. But here the big question
      arises <b>Is India ready for industry
      4.0?&nbsp;</b></span></span></div>

      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">According to
      the International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics 2016 published by UNIDO with its ranking
      going up by three places, India has now been ranked sixth among the world’s 10 largest
      manufacturing countries.&nbsp; The idea is to encourage multi-national, as well as
      national companies to manufacture their products in India. With a large of crippling
      regulations and under-developed infrastructure, the Government is focusing more on enabling
      policies and improving infrastructure for certain key
      sectors.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

      <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-kerning: none;">According to
      IBEF, the Government of India has set an ambitious target of increasing </span><span
      style="background-color: white; font-kerning: none;"><br />
      </span><span style="font-kerning: none;">the contribution of manufacturing output
      to 25 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025, from 16 percent currently. IoT, is one
      of the most important aspects of Industry 4.0 for India, is expected to capture close to 20
      percent share in the global IoT market</span><span style="background-color: white;
      font-kerning: none;"> </span><span style="font-kerning: none;">in the next five
      years. According to the IBEF forecast, the IoT market in India is
      projected</span><span style="background-color: white; font-kerning: none;">
      </span><span style="font-kerning: none;">to grow at a CAGR of more than 28 percent
      during 2015-2020.&nbsp; The government of India has taken initiatives such as Green
      Corridors and ‘Make in India’ .&nbsp;</span></span></div>

      <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-kerning: none;">Major Indian
      states are taking initiatives to adapt to Industry 4.0 like&nbsp; Andhra Pradesh has taken
      an initiative to capitalize on the IoT potential in the country. The state government has
      approved the first-of-its-kind IoT policy with an aim to turn the state into an IoT hub by
      2020 and tap close to 10 percent market share in the country.&nbsp; The Indian government
      has created Green Energy Corridors to bring in more renewable energies, to make smart grids
      that will support the variable input of renewable energies and create storage. India has
      committed over 1 billion dollars in this initiative and has started projects in many states,
      such as Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Himachal Pradesh.

      machines speak with each other, is being set up in Bengaluru. It is making progress at the
      Indian Institute of Science’s (IISc) Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing (CPDM) with
      an investment from The Boeing Company. A smart factory, armed with data exchange in
      manufacturing and the Internet of Things (IoT) is the future and experts are calling it
      revolution Industry 4.0. Reports peg the smart factory industry to touch&nbsp; 215 billion
      us dollars by 2025 and all major economies are likely to accept
      it.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Various Indian
      companies are increasing their focus and partnering with other companies for developing new
      IoT and M2M solutions, the Digital India initiative from the Government of India is expected
      to enhance the focus on IoT in tackling the domestic
      challenges.</span></span></div>

      <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-kerning:
      none;">&nbsp;Several enterprises taking this responsibility seriously and understand
      the importance of upcoming tech trends as some of the examples of enterprises are Bajaj Auto
      was one of the first automotive enterprises to initiate automation in the industry. It
      commenced the process of automation in 2010, today it uses 100-120 Collaborative Robots in its
      production facilities. Maruti Suzuki manages 7 process shops and 5 assembly lines by around
      1,700 robots. Ford has managed to operate the assembly lines and body shop of its Sanand Plant
      by 437 robots. Hyundai has also taken steps to minimize its labor cost by utilizing over 400
      robots in Sriperumbudur Plant. The production lines of Tata Nano consist of over 100 robots in
      the Sanand Plant of Tata Motors. Other enterprises such as Renault are doing some rather
      interesting work in the field of automation of the business processes to prevent accidents.

      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result,
      companies are warming up to the idea of connected machines. While Industry 3.0 simply was
      about the automation of isolated machines, Industry 4.0 concentrates on the end-to-end
      digitization of all physical assets and their integration into digital ecosystems with value
      chain partners”. Essentially, the new paradigm is about the integration is evidenced by the
      2016 Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum, held at Davos where the “Fourth Industrial
      Revolution” was the key topic.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

      <div style="font-family: Baskerville; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;
      text-indent: 27px;">
      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">India’s
      competitive landscape is continuously changing. Countries are constantly being challenged on
      technical capabilities Specifically, India faces competition from China and Europe and there
      is a risk of her being crowded out by the increasing technical capabilities of these regions
      as they are focusing on medium- value segments where India has always been prominently
      operating.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
      <div style="font-family: Baskerville; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;
      min-height: 14px; text-indent: 27px;">

      <div style="font-family: Baskerville; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;
      text-indent: 27px;">
      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">For more than
      20 years now, India and China have been competing for the major share of global manufacturing.
      India’s manufacturing contribution to GDP still is a mere 16% compared to 36% for China. There
      is, however, an opportunity to turn the tide in India’s favor as China’s shrinking labor
      arbitrage and strengthening Yuan against the US Dollar has encouraged investors to look
      towards more cost-effective destinations like Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. India’s advantage
      is its ample supply of skilled technical labor and low cost of manufacturing. Already Havells,
      Godrej, Bosch, and other large manufacturers have shifted units to
      India.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;">
      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: small;">India’s Strength
      over others&nbsp;</span></span></h3>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">Presence of a large pool of skilled and
      semi-skilled people with a strong educational system.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">Favorable government policies like lower
      excise duties, automotive mission plans, the constitution of NEMMP (National Electric Mobility
      Mission Plan 2020), FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid land Electric Vehicle)
      are advantageous for the sector. </span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">India ranks third in terms of a preferred
      investment destination. (Just after China and the United States) India has emerged as one of
      the most attractive destinations not only for investment but also for doing business in recent
      years. </span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">Lower cost of production due to lower labor
      rates </span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">Existing Natural resources
      </span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">English as one of the major business
      languages </span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: medium;">India's location, close to markets of South
      East Asia, the Middle East and also Europe.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Well here I
      just mentioned a few and most appropriate advantages but there are more than this like
      Improving Infrastructure, Robust Financial Sector &amp; Large Workforce,
      etc.</span></span></div>

      <div style="font-family: Baskerville; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;
      text-indent: 27px;">
      <span style="font-kerning: none;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is obvious
      that Indian enterprises have to understand the importance of industry 4.0 sooner rather than
      later and on behalf of doing great work by our government since 2014 and may continuously
      progress in this way than&nbsp; we can say that “yes that India is ready for
      upcoming&nbsp; industry 4.0 ecosystem”</span></span></div>
