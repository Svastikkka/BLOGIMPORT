      A quantum computer is one that exploits quantum-mechanical interactions in order to function;
      this behavior, found in nature, possesses the incredible potential to manipulate data in ways
      unattainable by machines today.&nbsp; The harnessing and organization of this power,
      however, poses no small difficulty to those who quest after it.&nbsp;</div>

      Subsequently, the concept of quantum computing, birthed in the early ’80s by physicist Richard
      Feynman, has existed largely in the realm of theory.&nbsp; Miraculous algorithms that
      potentially would take a billionth of the time required for classical computers to perform
      certain mathematical feats, and are implementable only on quantum computers, as such have not
      yet been realized.&nbsp; A two-bit quantum system, recently developed by a coalition of
      researchers, constitutes the sole concrete manifestation of the idea.</div>

      The bit, most basic unit of information within a computer, is the building block for all data
      residing within.&nbsp; An alphanumeric character, for example, usually consumes 1 byte,
      or&nbsp; 8 bits, of memory.&nbsp; A 2-byte unsigned integer would be allowed to range
      from 00000000 00000000 to 11111111 1111111 in binary, or 0-65535 in decimal notation
      (0-2<span style="box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 0; position: relative; top: -0.5em;
      vertical-align: baseline;">16</span>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

      The “bit” of a quantum computer, referred to as Qubit (short for a quantum bit), might be
      represented as an atom.&nbsp; Qubits, however, possess an intrinsic and most significant
      quality: they may simultaneously be assigned 0 or 1, the probability of each expressed as a
      numerical coefficient.&nbsp; This ability allows quantum computers to exist in multiple
      states at once, called superposition by those knowledgeable of such things.&nbsp;
      Subsequently, actions may be carried out in all states simultaneously, allowing parallel
      operations to be performed with one processing unit.&nbsp; A phenomenon dubbed
      “entanglement” joins Qubits together in a quantum system.</div>

      Super positioning opens the way for several fascinating and potentially problematic uses for
      quantum computers.&nbsp; Factoring numbers of several hundred digits, a tactic needed to
      crack some encryption schemes currently in use, would take billions of years on the fastest
      supercomputers.&nbsp; Theoretically, this might take a year on quantum
      computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly daunting mathematical tasks, researchers speculate,
      will become trivial also.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); color: #202020; font-family:

      The difficulty in sustaining a quantum computer lies in its nearly unavoidable contact with an
      external environment, interactions with which inexorably lead to collapse, termed decoherence,
      of the system. The use of NMR technology with fluids has produced quantum computers of a
      couple of bits (see&nbsp;<a

      inherit; color: var(--link-color);">History/Developments</a>), but these systems lose
      coherence after a few minutes, allowing at most 1000 operations before succumbing to the
      thermal motion produced by the molecules in the liquid.</div>

      Well there are 3 types of quantum computing system in the world.which
      are&nbsp;</div>

      1.&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing: inherit;">QUANTUM
      ANNEALING</strong>:-&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum annealing is best for solving
      optimization problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, researchers are trying to find the
      best (most efficient) possible configuration among many possible combinations of
      variables.</div>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); color: #202020; font-family:
      Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom: 1.25em;">
      2.&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing: inherit;">QUANTUM
      SIMULATIONS</strong>:-&nbsp;&nbsp;An another type of quantum machine for
      calculating the most difficult problems. Quantum simulations&nbsp;explore specific
      problems in quantum physics that are beyond the capacity of classical systems. Simulating
      complex&nbsp;quantum phenomena could be&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;most important
      applications of quantum computing.</div>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); color: #202020; font-family:
      Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom: 1.25em;">
      3.&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing: inherit;">UNIVERSAL
      QUANTUM&nbsp;COMPUTING</strong>:- Universal quantum computers are the most powerful
      and most generally applicable, but also the hardest to build. A truly universal quantum
      computer would likely make use of over 100,000 qubits some estimates put it at
      1Million&nbsp;&nbsp;qubits. Remember that today, the most qubits we can access is not
      even 128. The basic idea behind the universal quantum computer is that you could direct the
      machine at any massively complex computation and get a quick solution. This includes solving
      the aforementioned annealing equations, simulating quantum phenomena, and more.</div>

      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">The spark of quantum computing was struck by Mr.
      Richard Feynman. In 1981 at MIT,&nbsp;</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">In 1994, Peter Shor developed his algorithm allowing
      quantum computers to efficiently factorize large integers exponentially quicker than the best
      classical algorithm on traditional machines.&nbsp;</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">In 1996, Lov Grover invented a quantum database search
      algorithm that presented a quadratic speedup for a variety of problems. Any problem which had
      to be solved by random or brute-force search could now be done 4x faster.</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">In 1998, a working 2-qubit quantum computer was built
      and solved first quantum algorithms such as Grover’s algorithm. The race into a new era of
      computer power began and more and more applications were developed.</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">Twenty years later, in 2017, IBM presented the first
      commercially usable quantum computer, raising the race to another level.</li>
