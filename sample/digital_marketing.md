      Today I talk about another non-technical field which is the digital marketing field and also
      an interesting point that I would like to share is that I am currently doing an internship in
      it.</div>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      Sounds crazy right, a person whose background is technical why he is doing a non-tech
      job/intern and your question is right but some times before choosing a particular field you
      have to explore and this what I am doing. I really enjoying internship in this field same as
      my past technical field&nbsp; internship but now enough talk let’s jump straight into on
      topic which is Digital Marketing&nbsp;</div>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      So What is Digital Marketing?</div>
      <h2 style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      Definition&nbsp;</h2>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      According to Mr. Neil Patel (co-founder of<span
      class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a
      href="https://npdigital.com/">NP Digital</a>), it’s is advertising delivered through
      digital channels. Channels such as social media, mobile applications, email, web applications,
      search engines, websites, or any new digital channel.</div>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      In other words (my words), advertising through digital channels such as promote yourself
      (product/company/brand anything) in social media is called digital marketing.</div>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      So now we know about digital marketing but here is another question that arises why it is
      important? Which is a good question for beginners?</div>
      <h2 style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      &nbsp; Importance&nbsp;</h2>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      So A digital marketing strategy is a powerful tool for any startup because it does not kill
      the budget. There are six reasons to prioritize optimization for every business
      owner.&nbsp;</div>
      <ol style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      <li><strong>Digital marketing delivers customer behavior data into
      startups</strong>:-&nbsp; Let’s take an example, an entrepreneur who recently
      started his company but he does not have much data about his audience. Digital marketing helps
      in collecting that data over time. They can take advantage of it for a long time after
      starting their business.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Marketing results in high traffic and
      conversions</strong>:- Digital marketing helps startups to get traffic that can get
      conversion and revenue.&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of spending money on social media
      advertising and other marketing strategies, recommend making digital marketing and currently
      living with Google's best practices. Maybe you're setting up a product or you're a publisher
      and you're trying to get the impression. If you can rank specific keywords that do not have
      high searches and they are not very competitive as some long-tail keywords, then you can start
      running organic traffic. It has been proved that organic traffic - traffic that comes from a
      search like Google - 400 percent better than any other type of traffic other than email
      marketing.</li>
      <li><strong>Its Free:</strong>- Biggest advantage of digital marketing is
      that it is free or cheap in comparison to traditional marketing. You only create an account on
      a social media platform and through social media platforms, you can advertise your products,
      services, build a targeted audience or anything you want.</li>
      <li><strong>Branding</strong>:- In today’s landscape, brands are built in
      the digital world. Digital advertising offers an opportunity to extoll the benefits of your
      service to the people most interested in them.</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility</strong>:- An organization with a strong digital
      presence can expand its audience in ways businesses could only have dreamed of 25 years
      ago.</li>
      <li><strong>Access</strong>:- The more entrances you have to your
      organization, the more people are likely to come inside. That, in essence, is what digital
      marketing is: A series of doors leading people to learn more about your organization. An
      individual may have heard of your brand before, but maybe it’s a shared social post or an
      email newsletter that leads them to explore your website and dig a little deeper. If that door
      wasn’t there, they couldn’t have opened it.</li>
      <li><strong>Community</strong>:- Most companies have a network in place that
      is essential to business building fellow professionals, former clients, partners, vendors,
      consultants, etc. Digital marketing gives you the ability to build up similar networks online.
      For example, you may have your&nbsp;Linkedin circle where you share information about your
      service/product or anything and build connections with people in your industry. This may lead
      to referrals or unexpected partnerships that wouldn’t have happened. Such a trick is the power
      of digital community building.</li>
      <li><strong>Data</strong>:- Another big advantage of any company is that
      these are so many analytics tools available to show you things like who’s viewing what, how
      many people were interested in a specific piece content, or what email got the best response.
      And you can view this data instantly.</li>
      </ol>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      So here some of the advantages of digital marketing and because of these advantages, digital
      marketing becomes essential for any company.&nbsp;</div>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      Now we understand it. Importance but posting newsfeed in social media is digital
      marketing?</div>
      <div style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-size-adjust: auto;">
      The answer is definitely not, digital marketing is vast and there are many sub-fields which
      are as follows:-</div>

      keywords, the user’s location at the time of searching, and their browsing history. &nbsp;
      Simply The higher you rank on a SERP, the more traffic is directed to your site and the more
      chances of making a passive visitor an active customer. Search engine optimization includes
      many factors from keywords within your content to links to your website around the web. It
