      manner.</div>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); color: #202020; font-family:
      Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom: 1.25em;">
      Soft skills are personal attributes that can affect relationships, communication, and
      interaction with others. Soft skills can include, or relate to, the following:</div>

      0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.25em;">

      Soft skills aren’t generally “all or none.” Many people are suffiencent&nbsp; or even
      exemplary with some skills yet&nbsp; struggle with others. For instance, you may have
      excellent communication and teamwork abilities but struggle with&nbsp;time
      management&nbsp;or crack under pressure.&nbsp;</div>

      Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom: 1.25em;">
      It’s not uncommon to either underestimate the importance of soft skills or overestimate your
      own proficiency. Here are a few common scenarios that may be improved with stronger soft
      skills:</div>

      0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.25em;">

      having difficult conversations, can be learned, but are often not
      taught.&nbsp;</div>
      <ol style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); color: #202020; font-family:
      Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; list-style-image: initial; list-style-position: initial; margin:

      inherit;">Empathy</strong>:-&nbsp; Empathy, an&nbsp; important soft skill
      that&nbsp; anyone needs when starting his/her carrier. Without empathy, you won’t

      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">Teamwork motivates unity in the workplace:- A teamwork
      environment promotes an atmosphere that fosters friendship and loyalty. These motivate
      employees in parallel and align them to work harder, cooperate and be supportive of one
      another.</li>

      workplace allows one to evaluate what is happening and adjust to the role and responsibilities
