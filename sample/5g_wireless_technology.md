      Want to know about the upcoming 5th generation wireless technology then you come into right
      place. In this we take a deep look about 5G technology and how it is emerging around us. Let’s
      see how 5G technology is about to change the world.</div>

      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      5G Wireless Technology is now the latest cellular technology that will greatly increase the
      speed of wireless networks among other things. So the data speed for wireless broadband
      connections using 5G would be at a maximum of around&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing:
      inherit;">10 Gbps to 20 Gbps</strong>. It’s all about making better use of the radio
      spectrum and enabling far more devices to access the mobile internet at the same time also it
      will deliver new levels of performance and efficiency that will empower new user experiences
      and connect new industries.</div>

      <span style="font-size: small;">What will it enable us to do?</span></h2>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:

      5G is a new kind of network in which&nbsp; a platform for innovations that will not only
      enhances today’s mobile broadband services, but will also expand mobile networks to support a
      vast diversity of devices and services and connect new industries with improved performance,
      efficiency, and cost. 5G will redefine a broad range of industries with connected services
      from retail to education, transportation to entertainment, and everything in between. We see
      5G as technology as transformative as the automobile and electricity.</div>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: black; margin-bottom:

      In general 5G use cases can be broadly categorized into three main types of connected
      services:</div>

      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit;">Enhanced
      Mobile Broadband</strong>:- 5G will not only make our smartphones better, but it will
      also usher in new immersive experiences, such as Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, with
      faster, more uniform data rates, lower latency, and cost-per-bit.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="box-sizing: inherit; caret-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); color: #202020; font-family:

      transform industries with ultra-reliable/available, low latency links such as remote control
      of critical infrastructure, vehicles, and medical procedures.&nbsp; Also 5G will
      seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors in virtually everything through the
      ability to scale down in data rates, power and mobility to provide extremely lean/low-cost
      solutions.</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit;">Enable
      Future Capability</strong>:- A defining capability of 5G is also the design for forward
      compatibility—the ability to flexibly support future services that are unknown
      today.</li>

      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      The other mobile network generations are 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G.</div>

      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">1G delivered analog voice.</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">2G introduced digital voice (e.g.,

      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">3G brought mobile data (e.g.,
      CDMA2000).&nbsp;</li>
      <li style="box-sizing: inherit;">4G LTE ushered in the era of mobile

      <span style="font-size: small;">How 5G works</span></h2>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      Like 4G LTE, 5G is also OFDM-based and will operate based on the same mobile networking
      principles. Wireless networks are composed of cell sites divided into sectors that send data
      through radio waves. Fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)&nbsp;wireless
      technology provides the foundation for 5G. Unlike 4G, which requires large, high-power cell
      towers to radiate signals over longer distances, 5G wireless signals will be transmitted via
      large numbers of small cell stations located in places like light poles or building
      roofs.&nbsp;</div>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      New antennas will incorporate technology known as massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple
      output), which enables multiple transmitters and receivers to transfer more data at the same
      time. But 5G technology is not limited to the new radio spectrum. It is designed to support a
      converged, heterogeneous network combining licensed and unlicensed wireless technologies. This
      will add bandwidth available for users.</div>
      <h2 style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica;
      line-height: 1.4; margin: 1em 0px 0.75em;">
      <span style="font-size: small;">When will 5G be available and how will it
      expand?</span></h2>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      5G service is already available in some areas in various countries. These early-generation 5G
      services are called 5G non-standalone (5G NSA). This technology is a 5G radio that builds on
      existing 4G LTE network infrastructure. 5G NSA will be faster than 4G LTE. But the high-speed,
      low-latency 5G technology the industry has focused on is 5G standalone (5G SA). It should
      start becoming available by 2020 and be commonly available by 2022.</div>
      <h2 style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica;
      line-height: 1.4; margin: 1em 0px 0.75em;">
      <span style="font-size: small;">What is the real-world impact of 5G
      technology?</span></h2>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      5G technology will not only opens the gate of&nbsp; new era of improved network
      performance and speed but also new connected experiences for users. In healthcare, 5G
      technology and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity will enable patients to be monitored via connected devices
      that constantly deliver data on key health indicators, such as heart rate and blood pressure.
      In the auto industry, 5G combined with ML-driven algorithms will provide information on
      traffic, accidents, and more; vehicles will be able to share information with other vehicles
      and entities on roadways, such as traffic lights. These are just two industry applications of
      5G technology that can enable better, safer experiences for users.</div>
      <h2 style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica;
      line-height: 1.4; margin: 1em 0px 0.75em;">
      <span style="font-size: small;">Conclusion&nbsp;</span></h2>
      <div style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Raleway, Arial, Helvetica; margin-bottom:
      1.25em;">
      5G is here, but so far, it’s a little underwhelming. But that should change as more cities
      come online and more 5G devices become available. Overall, 2019 is the year that 5G starts to
      take off, but 2020 is when next-generation networks will have a meaningful impact on the
      masses. Next year is not only when we expect the first 5G iPhone, it’s also when networks will
      offer nationwide coverage. That’s when we’ll begin to see the full potential of
      5G.</div>
